Problem Description

A company wants to create a social media application called "FriendMe". This app will promote
socializing between employees across offices. The application is almost complete but they need a
feature that finds mutual friends between users. This feature can make users more comfortable with
the app. Given that they have distributed servers across the globe, the CTO wants to use the
MapReduce framework to implement this feature, distributing the computation overhead. The CTO wants
you to simulate this feature in JavaScript.

Task

Your task in this project is to use your JavaScript knowledge to help implement the simulation of
the MapReduce framework. Then, the CTO will know if it is possible to create a MapReduce
implementation for the companyâ€™s servers.
